Here I have all the sourcecode from the book C in a Nutchell 2e  
Some of the examples I have recoded, added some features and comments.  
## How I put this to work

I use latest VS Code editor with following extensions, Better C++ Syntax, Bracket Pair Colorizer 2, C/C++, Code Runner, GitHub Pull Requests and Issues, GitLens - Git supercharged and Insert-special-symbol
