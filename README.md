# Code examples from C in a Nutshell, 2nd edition

Here I have all the sourcecode from the book C in a Nutchell 2e  
Some of the examples I have recoded, added some features and comments.
I've also planned to add some listings in the book that is not added as an example 
## How I put this to work
My OS is Linux Mint 20.2  
I use latest VS Code editor with following extensions, Better C++ Syntax, Bracket Pair Colorizer 2, C/C++, Code Runner, GitHub Pull Requests and Issues, GitLens - Git supercharged and Insert-special-symbol  

I have also installed the packages build-essential, manpages-dev, gcc-10 and g++-10  


Happy coding, 02.09.2021
