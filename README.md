# Codeexamples from C in a Nutshell, 2nd edition

Here I have all the sourcecode from the book C in a Nutchell 2e  
Some of the examples I have recoded, added some features and comments.  
## How I put this to work
My OS is Linux Mint 20.2  
I use latest VS Code editor with following extensions, Better C++ Syntax, Bracket Pair Colorizer 2, C/C++, Code Runner, GitHub Pull Requests and Issues, GitLens - Git supercharged and Insert-special-symbol  

I have also installed the packages build-essential, manpages-dev, gcc-10 and g++-10  

### My use of version tags of this project:
I initially used the command git tag -a "v0.4.5-build" -m "version v0.4.5-build"

Where [major] or 0 as it is now, I'll increment this to 1 when I've completed to comment and test all the examples in the book.
Where [minor] or 4 as it is now, increments with 1 as soon as I've completed one more example that is uppdated with comment's and tested as well.
Where [patch] or 5 as it is now, will increment as soon as I add an example or change something in an existing example.

Behind the build text you  number you will se what commit I'm on and a it's hash number.

Happy coding, 02.09.2021
